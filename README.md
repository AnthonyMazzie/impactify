## Introduction
Let’s be honest, engineers are great at building things, but when it comes to explaining the impact of what we've built, it’s not always easy. We know we’ve improved performance, saved time, or reduced costs, but putting that into words that actually make sense to others? That’s the tricky part.

That’s where impactify comes in. It helps you turn your work into a clear, concise impact statement in seconds. You just tell it what you did, how it helped the business, and what results you achieved. It’ll clean everything up and format it perfectly. No worrying about punctuation, capitalization, or handling acronyms.

Plus, once you have your statement, you can export it in multiple formats: print it out, save it to JSON, Markdown, or just copy it directly to your clipboard for easy sharing.

## Features
- **Automatic Formatting**: You give it the details, and impactify makes sure everything’s formatted right—punctuation, capitalization, and all.
- **Acronym Handling**: It keeps your acronyms looking right by preserving their case.
- **Whitespace Cleanup**: It takes care of any excess spaces, so your statement is neat and tidy.
- **Field Validation**: It checks if you missed anything or went over the character limit, so you don’t have to worry about it.
- **Flexible Export Options**: Once your impact statement is generated, you can easily print it, save it as JSON or Markdown, or copy it to your clipboard.

## Installation

You can install `impactify` globally for easy command-line use:

```bash
npm install -g impactify
```

## Basic Usage

### Command-Line Usage

Once installed globally, you can run `impactify` directly from the command line to generate impact statements based on input prompts.

This command will guide you through entering the details for your impact statement, including the action, business impact, specific impact, and goal alignment.
